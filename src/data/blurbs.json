            "title": "Evaluation of family policies: focus on parental leave policy take-up and its determinants and outcomes",
            "introduction": "The arrival of children affects the personal and professional lives of parents, as well as the division of paid and unpaid work within a couple. Research on post-birth employment shows that women with young children are less likely to participate in the labour market than men, women without children, or women whose children are older. All of this can have a negative impact on their careers and future professional trajectories, as well as on their wages and future pensions. Parental leave is one of the policies designed to reduce the negative consequences of parenthood and to promote gender equality in the division of tasks between women and men. It allows parents to devote part of their time to childcare while retaining the right to return to their previous job.\nThe success of a parental leave scheme depends on its use by the intended beneficiaries. The success and effectiveness of a parental leave policy depend on its uptake among the target population of eligible parents. If the take-up rate among parents falls below expectations, the policy objectives may not be achieved.\nStudies conducted by researchers at the Luxembourg Institute of Socio-Economic Research (LISER) have analysed the impact of the parental leave reform on take-up. These studies reveal that the reform led to a significant increase in the use of parental leave, particularly among fathers, thus marking an unprecedented development in this area.",
            "conclusion": "Data on the adoption of policies such as parental leave, and on inequalities in take-up among different groups of eligible parents, are highly relevant for research on social inequalities. These data reveal which segments of the population are able to benefit from policies that facilitate the reconciliation of family responsibilities and paid work. Segments of the population that systematically and significantly make use of workâ€“family reconciliation policies, such as women and employees in certain economic sector, are more likely to engage in childcare and to develop stronger relationships with their children compared to their counterparts in other sectors. When parental leave uptake is more evenly distributed among different groups of parents, the gap between family responsibilities and paid work, as well as the associated advantages and disadvantages, also tends to narrow. Thus, understanding inequalities in parental leave uptake also makes it possible to identify and better comprehend the sources of other social inequalities.",
