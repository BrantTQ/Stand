            "title": "Child wellbeing in Luxembourg",
            "introduction": "Understanding how children perceive their daily lives and their economic and social environment is essential to assessing their well-being. Traditional indicators often rely on objective measures, such as household income, material deprivation, and school performance, but these are not enough to capture children’s lived experience. A comprehensive understanding of child well-being is crucial for designing and implementing policies that effectively address their needs and promote equitable development.",
            "conclusion": "In 2023, child well-being in Luxembourg is 8.1 on average, but this figure varies with age (younger children tend to be more satisfied with their lives than older children), gender (boys are generally more satisfied than girls), and family status (children from single-parent families are less satisfied).",

            "title": "Parental perceptions of child wellbeing",
            "introduction": "Parents spend time, money, and emotional resources to support their children, but they may not have all the information needed to make the best choices. This project looks at whether parents’ views of their children’s wellbeing match what children themselves say, across areas like emotions and friendships. We then measure how much of any gap comes from differences in opinions versus parents lacking accurate or complete information.",
            "conclusion": "Parents in Luxembourg systematically underestimate the socio-emotional difficulties reported by their children across a variety of dimensions. About half of this difference seems to happen because parents don’t have the full picture of what their children are going through. Using an experimental design, we find that giving parents better information can help close this gap and guide them to support their children in more effective ways.",

                "introduction": "Between 2009 and 2023, inequalities in Luxembourg’s secondary schools increased across all four dimensions. The share of students not speaking Luxembourgish or German at home rose from 35% to over 54%, those from precarious work households from 10% to over 13%, while poverty grew slightly from 8% to 9%. Children from single-parent families more than doubled, from 3% to over 7%. However, more concerning are the disparities at school level: in 2023, poverty ranged from 2% to nearly 20%, work precarity from under 4% to almost 20%, and linguistic diversity from fewer than 5% to over 80%. Inequalities are thus not only rising but also highly unevenly distributed across schools – a trend requiring close attention.",
                "conclusion": "The concentration of disadvantage in certain schools is a critical concern, as it risks reinforcing unequal opportunities and undermining cohesion. Some schools face combined pressures of poverty, work precarity, linguistic diversity, and family fragility, making them particularly vulnerable. Addressing this requires research and policy cooperation: joint efforts are needed to better understand the drivers and consequences of unequal distribution, and to identify the most effective solutions. Targeted school-level measures—for instance, language support, additional teaching resources, and social services—are essential, while broader contextual factors such as housing patterns, labour market conditions, taxation, and social policy should not be ignored. Preventing excessive concentrations of disadvantage is key to ensuring equitable opportunities across Luxembourg’s schools.",
